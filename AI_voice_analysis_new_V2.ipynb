I'm 23 years old and I graduated from high school in 2008 from Londora High School. Londora is the city where I grew up. Londora is approximately 30 minutes away from Los Angeles and only 45 minutes from the beach. I graduated from high school with a 3.0 GPA. While I was in high school I was also a marching man. I played many instruments including the trombone, trumpet, drums, and guitar. After high school I continued my education at Citrus College which is also located in Londora, California. At Citrus College I obtained two associates degrees. I obtained one degree in Administration of Justice or Criminal Justice and another in Biological, Physical Sciences, and Mathematics. After college I got a job part time with the City of Ontario as a police cadet. As a police cadet I was able to help many citizens in the City of Ontario with police related problems. After becoming a police cadet I went on to become a Sheriff's Deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. In order for me to become a Sheriff's Deputy I had to graduate a six month long academy which was very tough. It required a lot of hard work. After I became a Sheriff's Deputy I decided I wanted to do something different so I became a service agent for a car rental company called Enterprise where I work today. My goal for this video is to be able to show you that I have a strong interest in teaching. Not only do I want to be able to travel the world but I want to be able to use my education and knowledge of the English language that I have learned since I was a child to other students who want to learn. So if you are able to consider me for this position I greatly appreciate it. Again my name is Paul Bernal and I appreciate your time. Thank you.\""
